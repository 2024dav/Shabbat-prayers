    <h2>Blessing of the Wine</h2>
    <h4>Genesis 2</h4>
    <p>
    
      1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, along with everything in them.<br>
      2 On the seventh day God was finished with his work which he had made, so he <br>
        rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.<br>
      3 God blessed the seventh day and separated it as holy; because on that day<br>
        God rested from all his work which He had created, so that it itself could produce.<br>
    </p> 
    <p>Blessed art thou, King of the universe, who creates fruit of the vine.<br>
       Blessed art thou, King of the universe, who sanctifies us with His commandments, <br>
       and has been pleased with us.<br>
       You have lovingly and willingly given us your Holy Shabbat as an inheritance, in memory of creation.<br>
       The Shabbat is the first among our Holy days, and remembrance of our exodus from Egypt.<br>
       Indeed, you have chosen us and made us Holy among all peoples and have lovingly and willingly <br>
       given us your Holy Shabbat as an inheritance

    </p>
    <h2>Washing of Hands</h2>
    <p>
        Bark atah Adonai, Eloheinu melekh ha-Olam, asher kidushanu b'mtzvotov, <br>
      v'tzivanu ai netilat yadayim<br>     
    </p>
    <p>
        Blessed art thou Oh Lord our God, King of the Universe, who has <br>
      sanctified us through your commandments and instructed us concerning the washing of hands.
    </p>

    <h2>Blessing for the Bread</h2>
    <p>
        Bark atah Adonai, Eloheinu melekh ha-Olam, hamotzi lechem mi ha'eretz.<br>
        <p>
            Blessed art thou Oh Lord our God, King of the Universe, who brings <br>
            forth Bread from the Earth for our use even Yeshua The True Bread from Heaven.
        </p>
        <h1>Shabbat Shalom!</h1>
    </p>
     <h2>Grace After Meal</h2>
     <h4>Birkat Ha-mon</h4>
     <h4>Genesis 8:22</h4>
     <p>
        Blessed art thou Oh Lord our God, King of the Universe, who provides the fruit of the<br>
        earth for our use. We bless you for fulfilling continually your promises that while the <br>
        earth remains, seedtime and harvest shall not fail.<br>
        Teach us to remember that it is not by bread alone that we live, grant us evermore to feed<br>
         on Him who is the true bread from Heaven, even Yeshua our Messiah.<br>
         Amen
