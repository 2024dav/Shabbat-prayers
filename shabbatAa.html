         <h2>Blessing for the Wife</h2>
            <p>
            10 Who can find a capable wife? Her value is far beyond that of pearls.<br>
            11 Her husband trusts her from his heart, and she will prove a great asset to him.<br>
            12 She works to bring him good, not harm, all the days of her life.<br>
            13 She procures a supply of wool and flax and works with willing hands.<br>
            14 She is like those merchant vessels, bringing her food from far away.<br>
            15 It's still dark when she rises to give food to her household and orders to the young women serving her.<br>
            16 She considers a field, then buys it, and from her earnings she plants a vineyard.<br>
            17 She gathers her strength around her and throws herself into her work.<br>
            18 She sees that her business affairs go well; her lamp stays lit at night.<br>
            19 She puts her hands to the staff with the flax; her fingers hold the spinning rod.<br>
            20 She reaches out to embrace the poor and opens her arms to the needy.<br>
            21 When it snows, she has no fear for her household; since all of them are doubly clothed.<br>
            22 She makes her own quilts; she is clothed in fine linen and purple.<br>
            23 Her husband is known at the city gates when he sits with the leaders of the land.<br>
            24 She makes linen garments and sells them; she supplies the merchants with sashes.<br>
            25 Clothed with strength and dignity, she can laugh at the days to come.<br>
            26 When she opens her mouth, she speaks wisely; on her tongue is loving instruction.<br>
            27 She watches how things go in her house, not eating the bread of idleness.<br>
            28 Her children arise; they make her happy; her husband too, as he praises her:<br>
            29 "Many women have done wonderful things, but you surpass them all!"<br>
            30 Charm can lie, beauty can vanish, but a woman who fears ADONAI should be praised.<br>
            31 Give her a share in what she produces; let her works speak her praises at the city gates.<br>
            Proverbs 31:10-31

            <h2>Blessing for the Husband</h2>
            <p>
            Psalms 112<br>
        
            1 Halleluyah! How happy is anyone who fears ADONAI, who greatly delights in his mitzvot.<br>
            2 His descendants will be powerful on earth, a blessed generation of upright people.<br>
            3 Wealth and riches are in his house, and his righteousness stands forever.<br>
            4 To the upright he shines like a light in the dark, merciful, compassionate and righteous.<br>
            5 Things go well with the person who is merciful and lends, who conducts his affairs with fairness;<br>
            6 for he will never be moved. The righteous will be remembered forever.<br>
            7 He will not be frightened by bad news; he remains steady, trusting in ADONAI.<br>
            8 His heart is set firm, he will not be afraid, till finally he looks in triumph at his enemies.<br>
            9 He distributes freely, he gives to the poor; his righteousness stands forever. His power will be increased honorably.<br>
            10 The wicked will be angry when they see this; they will gnash their teeth and waste away, the desires of the wicked will come to nothing.<br>

            <h2>Shema</h2>
            <p>
            4 "Sh'ma, Yisra'el! ADONAI Eloheinu, ADONAI echad <br>
                [Hear, Isra'el! ADONAI our God, ADONAI is one];<br>
            5 and you are to love ADONAI your God with all your heart, all yougr being and all your resources.<br>
            6 These words, which I am ordering you today, are to be on your heart;<br>
            7 and you are to teach them carefully to your children. You are to talk about them when you sit at home, <br>
                when you are traveling on the road, when you lie down and when you get up.<br>
            8 Tie them on your hand as a sign, put them at the front of a headband around your forehead,<br>
            9 and write them on the door-frames of your house and on your gates.<br>
            Deutronomy 6:4-6
